deploying and infrastructure at scale


Cloud integrations: 150
when we start deploying multiple applications, they will communicate with one another, there are two types of app communication: directly, and via a queue
SQS: simple queue service
SNS: notification
Kinesis: real-time data streaming
Amazon MQ: should be only used when the company is migrating to the cloud and need to use one of the open protocols such as MQTT etc.
